# Indexr  
**AI-Powered Crypto Index Funds - Invest with structure, not speculation.**

Indexr is building the **Vanguard of Web3**: a new way to invest in crypto through AI-driven, decentralized index funds that automate token selection, portfolio rebalancing, and on-chain execution.

Our mission is simple: remove the chaos from crypto investing and replace it with structure, clarity, and long-term thinking.

## 🛠️ What We're Building

- **Core Funds**  
  Static, market-cap weighted portfolios (e.g. `INDXR-10`, `INDXR-DFI`, `INDXR-AI`)

- **Prime Funds**  
  Dynamic, AI-weighted portfolios that respond to on-chain data, sentiment, wallet flows, and macro trends

- **Smart Contracts**  
  ERC-4626-style vaults in Solidity, supporting secure deposits, redemptions, and AI-driven rebalances

- **AI Signals Engine**  
  Modular multi-agent system (OpenManus-RL + DeepSeek + live data) powering dynamic fund logic

## 🧠 AI Signals Engine

Indexr’s proprietary **AI Signals Engine** takes live data including wallet flows, social sentiment, on-chain volume, and macro factors - and scores tokens using modular AI agents. This signal determines how each Prime Fund rebalances in real time.
