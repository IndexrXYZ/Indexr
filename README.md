# Indexr  
**AI-Powered Crypto Index Funds. Invest with structure, not speculation.**

Indexr is building the **Vanguard of Web3** - AI-driven, decentralized index funds that automate token selection, portfolio rebalancing, and execution.

Our mission is simple: remove the chaos from crypto investing and replace it with clarity, automation, and long-term structure.

## üõ†Ô∏è What We're Building

- **Core Funds**: Static, market-cap weighted portfolios (e.g. INDXR-10, INDXR-DFI)
- **Prime Funds**: AI-weighted portfolios that respond to on-chain data, sentiment, wallet flows, and macro trends
- **Smart Contracts**: ERC-4626-style vaults built in Solidity, supporting secure deposits, redemptions, and rebalances
- **AI Signals Engine**: A modular multi-agent system using DeepSeek, OpenManus-RL, and real-time data to power dynamic rebalancing
